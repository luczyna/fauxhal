# FauxHAL

A faux API for development purposes. The intention here is to create the API structure you expect to use, but don't have access to yet. Is there a 2nd or 3rd party that your team is relying on to build the APIs your app needs? That sh*t is probably in the works, and threatens to change on you. 

Build your app they way you need it to work, and fake out your data calls. 

## Getting Started

```
npm install
```

## Using

In terminal #1, start our server:

```
node server.js
```
